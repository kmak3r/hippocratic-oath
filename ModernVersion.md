A modern version from Harvard Medical School (360 Video: The Class of 2017 recites the Oath, https://youtu.be/Kj4UdKVMb4k).

and to complete the afternoon, I would ask all of the graduates to stand, and any physicians or dentists who wish to reaffirm the oath.
Since the time of Hippocrates over 2000 years ago, medical practitioners have taken an oath to uphold the principles of the vocation to which they dedicate themselves. In setting forth these principles, the oath serves both as a contract with the community, and as an affirmation of the deep commitment to the profession.
Today class of 2017, you stand before family, friends, teachers and colleagues, poised to join a rich tradition of discovery and healing. Being mindful to the debt you owe to the mentorship of those who came before you, while recognizing that your work will inform the practices of those who follow, you have created an oath drawing on elements both ancient and recent. I now invite you, as a class, to articulate the ideals and principles that will guide you in your journey as physicians and dentists. Class

I swear to fulfill this covenant:
I pledge to use my whole spirit, knowledge and skills to serve my patients.
I will strive to cure wherever possible, to heal to the best of my abilities, and to comfort always.
I will constantly challenge my biases and assumptions, so that I can provide the best care to patients, regardless of color, creed, class, gender or nationality.
I will listen to and honor my patients' stories, by protecting their privacy and promoting their interests as they define them.
I pledge to serve my community. I will recognize the richness that others add to my life. I will be kind.
The principles of justice and equity will guide my actions, and I will work to combat not only the biological, but also the socio-political threats to health, especially for those with the least power to advocate for themselves.
I will honor my teachers who have nurtured my development. I pledge to avoid from complacency with my education, to constantly advance my understanding and help other to do the same.
I will remember that knowledge is only a tool. And in making new discoveries I shall never use people as a means to an end.
Finally, I will remember to nurture myself so I can be at my best to nurture others. In doing so, I will help create a universal culture of unconditional support and encouragement.
From this day forward, I commit to this oath joyfully, freely and upon my honor.

To the class of 2017, congratulations. Go forth to heal and enjoy the evening.
